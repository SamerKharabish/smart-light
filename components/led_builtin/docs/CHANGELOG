### Added

### Changed

### Removed

### Fixed

### Known Issues

- Changing or adding a new environment for an example may break PlatformIOs UI. The buttons in the bottom status bar will trigger the notification *Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)*. The firmware of the selected environment can neither be built, uploaded and "cleaning" the environment does also not work. Known solutions: either using directly *pio* commands or reloading the Window with ```Shift``` + ```Strg``` + ```P``` and selecting *>Developer: Reload Window*.
